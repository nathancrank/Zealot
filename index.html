        <h2>What?</h2>

<p>Zealot is a series of SASS mixins and functions that hopefully make your life a bit easier as you develop. They are organized with absolutely no logic, they exists with not permanence with zealot, and thats by design. This is my personal beta framework. It will always be v0.1.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Zealot wasn't really developed with any direct goal in mind. It is more a collection of mixins and functions that I found myself using with some frequency from project to project. Or I spent a whole sass-load of time figuring them out. Like the floating point truncate. That was a doozy. And yes, there has to be a far more efficient way to do that one, but no one else has done it yet that I could find, so give me some credit.</p>

<p>So things may (will) come and go from Zealot. But the things that go will be moved to newer more coherent libraries, stand alone releases, or disappear because they kind of sucked.</p>

<h2>Useable Documentation?</h2>

<p>Soon. But not yet.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:zealot@nathancrank.com">zealot@nathancrank.com</a> if you have questions.</p>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>

<p>Bleeding edge only. That said, if you design using the principles of progressive enhancement, then this supports everything.</p>
