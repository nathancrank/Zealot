They are organized with absolutely no logic, they exists with no permanence within Zealot, and that's by design. This is my personal beta framework. It will always be v0.1.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nZealot wasn't really developed with any direct goal in mind. It is more a collection of mixins and functions that I found myself using with some frequency from project to project. Or I spent a whole sass-load of time figuring them out. Like the floating point truncate. That was a doozy. And yes, there has to be a far more efficient way to do that one, but no one else has done it yet that I could find, so give me some credit.\r\n\r\nSo things may (will) come and go from Zealot. But the things that go will be moved to newer more coherent libraries, stand alone releases, or disappear because they kind of sucked.\r\n\r\n## Useable Documentation?\r\nSoon. But not yet.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nYou can email me at zealot@nathancrank.com if you have questions.\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\nBleeding edge only. That said, if you design using the principles of progressive enhancement, then this supports everything.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nNew BSD License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Nathan Crank\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n    * Neither the name of the <organization> nor the\r\n      names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\r\n      derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
